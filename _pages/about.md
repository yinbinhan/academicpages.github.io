I am a second-year Ph.D student at the [Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://ise.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Renyuan Xu and Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn. Before joining USC, I obtained my B.Sc in Mathematics from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/), when I was advised by Prof. Zizhuo Wang. Please find my [CV](./files/Han_Yinbin.pdf) here.
